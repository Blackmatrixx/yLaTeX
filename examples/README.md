# Examples
You will find in this folder some documents I made using the preambles and packages available on this wiki.

## TM
I made this document mainly during the sommer 2015. It uses XeLaTeX, infoBulle, my XeLaTeX preamble, the flatTables , the bigGrayBand typo (in this case it is red...) and some other stuffs.

This version is still a work-in-progress so it might contain bugs, unfinished parts, etc.
