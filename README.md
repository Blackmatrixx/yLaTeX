# LaTeX

I will put in this repo some LaTeX packages inclusions that I used, typo and packages that I made, etc. I hope it will be helpful.

I wrote as well one or two tutos in the wiki so don't hesitate to read them.

If you ever have a suggestion or question, simply ask! I will be glad to answer.

## latexPackages.tex
This is the default packages inclusion file that I use for my LaTeX documents. The comments explain clearly (at least I hope) what the packages do.
