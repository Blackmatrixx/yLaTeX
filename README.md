# yLaTeX

I will put in this repo some LaTeX packages inclusions that I used, typo and packages that I made, etc. I hope it will be helpful.

I wrote as well one or two tutos in the wiki so don't hesitate to read them.

If you ever have a suggestion or question, simply ask! I will be glad to answer.

## DefaultConfiguration
This folder contains the packages that I use as default configuration for nearly all my TeX and consort documents.

**Note that, as I now only use XeLaTeX, the LaTeX packages might be somewhat outdated. And one thing is sure: the XeLaTeX packages do produce much better visual results!**
